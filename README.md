Sales Analysis Project

This project performs an in-depth analysis of sales data to uncover trends, identify top-performing products, and determine the best times for advertising campaigns.

📈 Overview

The primary goal of this analysis is to use Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore a dataset of sales records. By cleaning, processing, and visualizing the data, we can answer key business questions and derive actionable insights.

🎯 Key Questions Answered by the Analysis

This analysis seeks to answer the following questions: What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month? Which city had the highest number of sales? What time of day should we display advertisements to maximize sales? What products are most often sold together? Which product sold the most and why?

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python: The core programming language for the analysis. Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and aggregation. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. Jupyter Notebook: As the environment for writing and presenting the analysis.

⚙️ Setup and Installation

To run this analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Piyush3355/Sales-Analysis.git cd Sales-Analysis

Unzip the project files: (Note: It is recommended to unzip Sales-Analysis-using-python-main.zip and commit the individual .ipynb or .py files directly to the repository for better version control and visibility.)

Install the required libraries: It's recommended to create a virtual environment first. Then, install the dependencies. pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyter

🚀 How to Run

Place the sales data files into a data/ directory within the project.
Open the main analysis file in Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook Sales-Analysis.ipynb
Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis and view the visualizations.
